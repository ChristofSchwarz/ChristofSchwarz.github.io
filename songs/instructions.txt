Requirements:

I want my own web-based music lyrics library, 
easy to maintain and add texts. Each song should have also
a bunch of attributes, by which on the front page I like to 
filter for/search:

- Song Name
- Interpret
- Year of release
- key
- bpm
- link to original song
- link to Karaoke version

That info is best maintained in a tabular format, such as xlsx.
The song texts themselves are best in html format to allow CSS formatting

I will need a fancy feature during performances, so that I enter a "play mode" in 
the song sheet. It should get access to my notebook camera and through video stream
analysis notice distinctive head moves, turn right is "forward scroll" in the text. 
Song lyrics will not fit on one page at once, scrolling needs to be made, but because
my hands are busy playing, I need a guesture control.

Hosting:

If the libraries (modules) do not require my own backend, I prefer hosting it on
christofschwarz.github.io ... otherwise a Azure Webservice (serverless) is an alternative.
Please consult me before making a decision.
