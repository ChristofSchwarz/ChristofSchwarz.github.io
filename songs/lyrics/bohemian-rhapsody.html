<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Is this the real life?<br>
Is this just fantasy?<br>
Caught in a landslide<br>
No escape from reality</em></p>

<p>Open your eyes<br>
Look up to the skies and see<br>
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
Because I'm easy come, easy go<br>
Little high, little low<br>
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me</p>

<h2>Verse 1</h2>
<p>Mama, just killed a man<br>
Put a gun against his head<br>
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br>
Mama, life had just begun<br>
But now I've gone and thrown it all away</p>

<p><strong>Mama, ooh<br>
Didn't mean to make you cry<br>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters</strong></p>

<h2>Verse 2</h2>
<p>Too late, my time has come<br>
Sends shivers down my spine<br>
Body's aching all the time<br>
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go<br>
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth</p>

<p><strong>Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)<br>
I don't wanna die<br>
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all</strong></p>

<h2>Guitar Solo</h2>
<p><em>[Instrumental guitar solo]</em></p>

<h2>Opera Section</h2>
<p><em>I see a little silhouetto of a man<br>
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?<br>
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me<br>
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico</em></p>

<p>I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me<br>
<em>He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br>
Spare him his life from this monstrosity</em></p>

<p>Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?<br>
<em>Bismillah! No, we will not let you go<br>
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
(Let me go!) Will not let you go<br>
(Let me go!) Will not let you go<br>
(Let me go!) Ah<br>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no</em></p>

<p><em>(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go<br>
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!</em></p>

<h2>Hard Rock Section</h2>
<p><strong>So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?<br>
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?<br>
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!<br>
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!</strong></p>

<h2>Outro</h2>
<p><em>Ooh<br>
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah</em></p>

<p>Nothing really matters, anyone can see<br>
Nothing really matters<br>
Nothing really matters to me</p>

<p><em>Any way the wind blows...</em></p>
