<h2>Verse 1</h2>
<p>On a dark desert highway<br>
Cool wind in my hair<br>
Warm smell of colitas<br>
Rising up through the air</p>

<p>Up ahead in the distance<br>
I saw a shimmering light<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br>
I had to stop for the night</p>

<h2>Verse 2</h2>
<p>There she stood in the doorway<br>
I heard the mission bell<br>
And I was thinking to myself<br>
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"</p>

<p>Then she lit up a candle<br>
And she showed me the way<br>
There were voices down the corridor<br>
I thought I heard them say</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)<br>
Such a lovely face<br>
Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>
Any time of year (Any time of year)<br>
You can find it here</strong></p>

<h2>Verse 3</h2>
<p>Her mind is Tiffany-twisted<br>
She got the Mercedes bends<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys<br>
That she calls friends</p>

<p>How they dance in the courtyard<br>
Sweet summer sweat<br>
Some dance to remember<br>
Some dance to forget</p>

<h2>Verse 4</h2>
<p>So I called up the Captain<br>
"Please bring me my wine"<br>
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here<br>
Since nineteen sixty-nine"</p>

<p>And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>
Just to hear them say</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)<br>
Such a lovely face<br>
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California<br>
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)<br>
Bring your alibis</strong></p>

<h2>Bridge</h2>
<p>Mirrors on the ceiling<br>
The pink champagne on ice<br>
And she said, "We are all just prisoners here<br>
Of our own device"</p>

<p>And in the master's chambers<br>
They gathered for the feast<br>
They stab it with their steely knives<br>
But they just can't kill the beast</p>

<h2>Verse 5</h2>
<p>Last thing I remember<br>
I was running for the door<br>
I had to find the passage back<br>
To the place I was before</p>

<p>"Relax, " said the night man<br>
"We are programmed to receive<br>
You can check out any time you like<br>
But you can never leave!"</p>
