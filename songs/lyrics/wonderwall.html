<h2>Verse 1</h2>
<p>Today is gonna be the day<br>
That they're gonna throw it back to you<br>
By now you should've somehow<br>
Realized what you gotta do</p>

<p>I don't believe that anybody<br>
Feels the way I do<br>
About you now</p>

<h2>Verse 2</h2>
<p>Backbeat, the word is on the street<br>
That the fire in your heart is out<br>
I'm sure you've heard it all before<br>
But you never really had a doubt</p>

<p>I don't believe that anybody<br>
Feels the way I do<br>
About you now</p>

<h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
<p>And all the roads we have to walk are winding<br>
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding<br>
There are many things that I<br>
Would like to say to you<br>
But I don't know how</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p><strong>Because maybe<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
And after all<br>
You're my wonderwall</strong></p>

<h2>Verse 3</h2>
<p>Today was gonna be the day<br>
But they'll never throw it back to you<br>
By now you should've somehow<br>
Realized what you're not to do</p>

<p>I don't believe that anybody<br>
Feels the way I do<br>
About you now</p>

<h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
<p>And all the roads that lead you there were winding<br>
And all the lights that light the way are blinding<br>
There are many things that I<br>
Would like to say to you<br>
But I don't know how</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p><strong>I said maybe<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
And after all<br>
You're my wonderwall</strong></p>

<p><strong>I said maybe<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
And after all<br>
You're my wonderwall</strong></p>

<h2>Outro</h2>
<p>I said maybe<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
You're gonna be the one that saves me</p>
